In "Settings"
    1. LEVELS is a list of lists, each list contains a layout for each level

In "Sprites"
    1.  ALL game objects are sprites (walls, player, exit, enemies, etc)
    2.  In Layout class:
        a. __init__ creates all of the groups for the sprite objects, and the level attribute
        b. "create_layout()" gets the list for the specific level (minus 1 to convert to correct index), empties all sprite groups, and loads the level
        c. "update()" call "exit_collide()", to check for collision with exit, and update all groups
        d. "exit_collide()"
            i. get player from player_grp
            ii. check for collision b/w player and exit group
            iii. if there is and level is less than max_level, increment level and call "create_level()"
            iv. else: set to quit() but would ultimately lead to game_over screen
